          At our hotel and resort, nestled right by the waters edge, there once
          stood an esteemed establishment comprising a charming restaurant and
          comfortable dormitories. In homage to its rich history, we have
          retained the cherished name and preserved the use of noble materials,
          infusing a touch of nostalgia into our contemporary design. Today, as
          you step into our revamped haven, we assure you an extraordinary
          experience that surpasses all expectations. Immerse yourself in the
          tranquil ambiance, where the echoes of the past harmonize with modern
          luxury.
